# Hash-Table-and-Its-Application
Hash Table class ADT was implemented, along with its application in operating user information
This project includes several files:
1). To test the Hash Table class implementation, you need to run hastable.h, hashtable.hpp, hashtable.h, and test_hashtable.cpp.
2). To test the PassServer class adaptor which uses HashTable class as an adaptee, you need to build a makefile that includes hashtable.h,
hashtable.hpp, passserver.h, passserver.cpp, and proj5_test.cpp
3). To fully make use of the hash table and passServer class to operate user information system, please run the makefile in this repository
